# Clean-Architecture-with-partitioned-repository-pattern-using-Azure-Cosmos-DB
This project provides a starting point to build a web API to work with Azure Cosmos DB using ASP.NET Core and Azure Cosmos DB .NET SDK V3, based on Clean Architecture and repository design pattern.  Partition key is also implemented through the repository pattern in order to support large scale Cosmos DB. A RESTful API application is created with popular architecture features (see list below) Clean Architecture is promoted by Microsoft on their .NET application architecture guide page. The e-book written by Steve "ardalis" Smith (@ardalis) is beautifully written and well explains the beauty and benefits of using Clean Architecture. For more details, please see Architect Modern Web Applications with ASP.NET Core and Azure  This project uses the newer Cosmos DB .NET SDK V3, because it adds support for stream APIs and Cosmos DB Change Feed processor APIs, as well as performance improvements.  Goals The primary goal of the project is to provide a basic solution structure for anyone who is building a new ASP.NET Core web or API project using Cosmos DB. Please watch for this repository to get notification when I make updates to the repo.  For a detailed discussion, please see my recent article, Clean Architecture — ASP.NET Core API using Partitioned Repository Pattern and Azure Cosmos DB (link: https://medium.com/swlh/clean-architecture-with-partitioned-repository-pattern-using-azure-cosmos-db-62241854cbc5)  Getting Started Download the Azure CosmosDB emulator in order to run the API project locally. Here is a download link: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cosmos-db/local-emulator-release-notes#download. Start the emulator Set the API project as your Startup project in Visual Studio The swagger UI page should be loaded at: https://localhost:5001/swagger/index.html Features supported ASP.NET Core 3.1 Azure Cosmos DB .NET SDK V3 Repository Design Pattern Partition Key REST API Swagger UI OData support IMemoryCache Cache service (Non-distributed in-memory cache) Serilog for structured logging MediatR Command/Query pattern MediatR pipeline behaviour for exception handling FluentValidation for validation AutoMapper to mapping Database initial creation Sample data seeding Email Sender using SendGrid CRUD endpoints using Cosmos DB Cosmos DB Point read using partition key and ID Search data in Cosmos DB using SQL query directly (demonstration purpose, not recommended in production) Search data in Cosmos DB using Parameterized Query Search data in Cosmos DB using LINQ and IQueryable Search data in Cosmos DB using Specification Pattern to abstract out query-specific logic ASP.NET Core Identity (TODO) Identity Service (TODO) Cosmos DB Change Feed (TODO) Cosmos DB Stored Procedure for Transaction (TODO) Acknowledgement Special thanks to Steve Smith (@ardalis) for sharing the CleanArchitecture repository and the e-book. I absolutely love it!  Thanks to Azure-Samples/PartitionedRepository for sample code using Cosmos DB .NET SDK V2, which helped me understand Cosmos DB .NET SDK V2 and compare SDK V2 against V3.
